Etch-Sketch. Part of the Odin Project

## Description
This is a very simple "graphic game/tool" that has as objective to learn about:
- Events
- Manipulating DOM's elements
- Alert and Prompt popup boxes
- Some color management using javascript

After the page is loaded, a grid of 16 by 16 cells is presented.
When the user moves the mouse over the cells, they change its color to a random one. 
After that, if the mouse is over again, the color becomes darker and darker until it becomes black.

There is the option to reset the grid and stablish the number of cells, the values allowed are between 1 and 100.
